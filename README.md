This repository contains the code and sequencing data used to filter the sequences and generate the data for the paper: "Resilience of microbial communities in semi-mature temperate oak trees to drought, nutrient limitation and pathogen challenge" [currently under review]

This respository contains the script used: Resilience_of_microbial_communities_in_semi_mature_temperate_oak_trees.Rmd

Contains the phyloseq object for bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequnces: ps_AOD_16S_filtered.RDS 
Contains the phyloseq obejct for fungal ITS gene sequences: ps_AOD_ITS_filtered_k_removed.RDS

The phyloseq objects also contain the metadata, classification tables and taxonomy data.
